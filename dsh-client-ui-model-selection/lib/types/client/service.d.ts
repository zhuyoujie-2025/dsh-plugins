/**
 * ModelDirectoryResolver (`ctx.modelDirectories`): the root owner of per-session
 * {@link ModelDirectory} instances. Both selection entries (the /model popup
 * and the composer model seat) resolve their session's directory through
 * this service, which is what makes the dual entry one shared state.
 *
 * Per-session storage follows the client service pattern (InputTriggerService /
 * CommandUiRuntime): a lazy service-internal map whose entry is deleted by the
 * owning scope's disposer. The host `dsh-scope` ScopedLayers registry does
 * does not belong here: it derives scope from the host carrier mechanism
 * (object-keyed), while client scopes tag contexts with branded SessionId
 * strings, and it models global+shadow named registries — this is a
 * per-session singleton with no global layer to merge.
