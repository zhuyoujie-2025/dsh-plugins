Unified notification push plugin for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH) — one minimal `notify()` API in front, 27 channels behind.

Your agent and the harness itself both push through it: session events (`turn/end` · `approval/asked` · `agent/error`) auto-notify, the model calls a `notify` tool directly, and six inbound channels bring approvals and conversations back from your phone. v0.3 adds a local web console and multi-agent routing; v0.4 adds native desktop notifications; v0.5 turns your phone into a command center — long-task heartbeats, stall alerts, and a stop button riding the notification itself; v0.7 upgrades "who counts as family" from opaque YAML strings into a runtime identity system — pairing codes, composite-key bindings, and a members page in the admin console — all with zero runtime dependencies.

## How it works

```
DSH agent ──notify() tool─────────┐
                                  ├─▶ notifier core ─▶ 27 channels (IM webhooks / push apps / China apps)
DSH session events ──auto push────┘   level routing · tiered retries · segmentation · anti-disturb · ledger
                                      heartbeat ⏱ / stall ⚠ (v0.5) ──▶ cards with a ⏹ stop button
your phone ──6 inbound channels───▶   remote approval (buttons · reply 1/2) · remote conversation (followup/inject/steer)
```

Every message resolves through one chain — level (`timeSensitive` / `active` / `passive`) → routing (multi-agent matrix) → channel adapter (`resolve(cfg)` + `send(msg)`). Two trigger lines feed it: the harness auto-pushes session events (debounced, deduped), and the model calls the `notify` tool. Six inbound channels ride the same core in reverse for approvals and conversation — and since v0.5 the outbound line reports back too: long-running turns send heartbeats, silent turns raise stall alerts, and Telegram/Feishu notifications carry a one-click stop action.

## Screenshots

The web admin console (`admin.enabled: true`, loopback only, mobile-friendly since v0.5) — all six pages (demo data):

| Page | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | session stats, outbound/inbound channel health groups, recent audit |
| **Notifications** (v0.4.0) | live SSE event stream, system-notification preferences, event log |
| **Members** (v0.7.0) | identity bindings (roles / labels / pairing time), pairing codes, pending-binding confirmations |
| **Bindings** | agent × channel checkbox grid, per-channel default agent |
| **Sessions** | per-session outbound resolution with override editing |
| **Channels** | credential forms for every channel (masked `***`), test send, QR scan |

## Quick start

```bash
dsh plugin add dsh-notifier --profile <profile-name>
```

> `--profile` is required (DSH 0.1.0-rc.6+): plugin installs target a named profile — use the one you run (e.g. `web`).

Add channels to your profile patch (`cordis.patch.yml`):

```yaml
insert:
  - id: dsh-notifier
    name: dsh-notifier
    config:
      channels:
        - type: telegram
          botToken: "123456:ABC-DEF..."
          chatId: "987654321"
        - type: dingtalk
          webhook: "https://oapi.dingtalk.com/robot/send?access_token=..."
          secret: "SEC..."
        - type: bark
          key: "your-device-key"
```

That's it. `turn/end`, `approval/asked`, and `agent/error` events now reach every configured channel, and the model can push on its own with `notify({ message, channel, title })`. Long tasks send heartbeats and stall alerts out of the box (v0.5 defaults), and you can stop a runaway turn right from the notification card.

## Core features

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Dual trigger lines** | Auto status push (`turn/end` · `approval/asked` · `agent/error`) plus a model-facing `notify` tool. |
| **27 channels** | Telegram, Slack, Discord, Feishu, DingTalk, WeCom, WeCom App, QQ bot, OneBot, Teams, Mattermost, Google Chat, Bark, Pushover, PushDeer, Chanify, ntfy, Gotify, iGot, WxPusher, PushPlus, Server酱, Qmsg, 息知, webhook, bell, desktop — zero runtime deps. |
| **Level routing** | `timeSensitive` / `active` / `passive` → per-channel delivery semantics (silent push, priority headers, @-mentions) with tiered retries. |
| **Remote approval** | Answer approvals from your phone — Telegram buttons, Feishu cards, QQ / WxPusher / WeChat iLink / DingTalk reply `1`/`2`. Silence never approves. |
| **Remote conversation** | Chat with your agent: plain text → `followup`/`inject`, `!` prefix steers mid-turn, a merge window reassembles mobile typing. |
| **Mobile command center** (v0.5.0) | Long-task heartbeats (default 15min start) and stall alerts (default 10min no events); Telegram/Feishu cards carry a ⏹ stop button (HMAC one-time tokens, same trust chain as approvals); `/quiet`·`/unquiet` mute or restore a session's pushes from your phone. |
| **Open event source** (v0.6.0) | Other plugins push via the `notifier` service (`ctx.inject(['notifier'], …)` — shared config, routing, ledger, rate limits, flush) and subscribe to every broadcast via `ctx.on('dsh-notifier/sent')`. Per-source rate limiting (10/min), 20k-codepoint clamps, never-reject API; consumer contract in [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md). |
| **Identity system** (v0.7.0) | "Who can drive inbound" becomes a runtime object: pairing codes (`/pair <code>` in any DM; first redeemer becomes owner), composite-key bindings (`channel:userId` — a Telegram-bound id no longer admits a Feishu message), role management (last owner can't be deleted or demoted), and rejection receipts that tell unbound senders how to get in. Empty whitelist boots into a guided state with a bootstrap pairing code on stderr instead of refusing to start. **Full setup-to-daily-use walkthrough: [docs/guide.md](docs/guide.md) (中文)**. |
| **Multi-agent routing** (v0.3.2) | Bidirectional agent × channel matrix; sessions auto-register; `/agent` command family + `route.mjs` CLI. |
| **Web admin console** (v0.3.3) | 127.0.0.1-only + Bearer token; six pages — dashboard / notify / members (v0.7) / bindings / sessions / channels; responsive ≤768px layout (v0.5). |
| **QR login** (v0.3.1) | One-command official scan authorization for QQ / DingTalk / Feishu (WeChat keeps iLink). |
| **Desktop notifications** (v0.4.0) | Native `desktop` channel (`osascript` / `notify-send` / PowerShell toast) + admin SSE live stream. |
| **Long-message segmentation** | Over-budget messages split into ordered `（i/n）` segments. |
| **Anti-disturb rules** | Per-result event gating, keyword include/exclude, idle grace window. |
| **Ledger & daily digest** | Append-only JSONL ledger + one `passive` summary of yesterday's traffic. |
| **Secrets safe** | `role('secret')` keys redacted everywhere; `${ENV:NAME}` refs keep secrets out of the profile. |
| **Never breaks startup** | Misconfigured channels are skipped silently with a log line. |

## Configuration

All channels live under `config.channels`. Key example:

```yaml
insert:
  - id: dsh-notifier
    config:
      channels:
        - type: telegram
          botToken: "123456:ABC-DEF..."
          chatId: "987654321"
        - type: feishu
          webhook: "https://open.feishu.cn/open-apis/bot/v2/hook/..."
        - type: wxpusher
          appToken: "AT_..."
          uids: ["UID_..."]
        - type: serverchan
          sct: "SCT..."
```

Optional blocks each opt in under their own key:

| Block | Purpose | Key |
|---|---|---|
| `inbound` | Remote approval + conversation | `allowUsers: [...]` (first-import only since v0.7; manage members at runtime via the admin console or `/pair`) |
| `approval` | Timeout, numbered reply, escalation | `mode: answer` |
| `conversation` | Merge window, steer prefix | `mergeWindowMs: 1500` |
| `route` | Multi-agent routing | `sessionTtlHours: 24` |
| `admin` | Web console | `enabled: true, port: 8104` |
| `events` / `keywords` / `graceSeconds` | Anti-disturb gates | `exclude: ["heartbeat"]` |
| `events.turnStart` / `longRunning` / `stall` | v0.5 status line | `longRunning: { firstAfterMs: 900000 }` |
| `digest` | Ledger + daily summary | `enabled: true` |

v0.5 status line defaults: `longRunning` and `stall` are **on** (15min first heartbeat, then every 15min; stall after 10min of silence) — zero-config long tasks are no longer a black box. `turnStart` is **off** by default (one message per turn is noise at the desk; turn it on when you fire a task and walk away). All timings clamp to a 60s floor; disable any of them with `enabled: false`.

<!-- CHANNEL-MATRIX-END -->

Six channels also open inbound (remote approval + conversation): `telegram`, `feishu`, `qq-bot`, `wxpusher`, `wechat`, `dingtalk` — long-lived connections or long polling, so no public IP is required (only the WxPusher callback needs one). Since v0.5, telegram and feishu additionally carry notification action cards (stop button). Since v0.7, every inbound channel answers `/help` `/whoami` `/pair` `/unpair` registration commands, and outbound card targets resolve through a three-tier priority (per-channel bindings → channel config lists → global fallback) with per-channel id-shape guards.

## Architecture

```
src/
  adapters/           27 channel adapters (resolve(cfg) + send(msg)) + declarative spec engine
  config.mjs          channel registry + config schema — single source of truth for the matrix
  index.mjs           plugin assembly: patch, tools, event listeners, admin wiring
  event-listener.mjs  auto-push line (debounce, dedup, level routing) + v0.5 status wiring
  status/             v0.5 turn tracker (heartbeat / stall detection, pure logic)
  actions.mjs         v0.5 notification action dispatch (turn/cancel, HMAC one-time tokens)
  notify.mjs          notify / notify_test tools + sliding-window rate limiting
  routing/            multi-agent matrix (resolveOutbound / resolveInbound)
  inbound/            six inbound channels (telegram/feishu/qq/wxpusher/wechat/dingtalk) + v0.7 identity stack
                      (identity.mjs bindings · pairing.mjs codes · commands.mjs registration · target-guard.mjs resolution)
  approval/           HMAC one-time tokens, dedup, escalation
  admin/              web console (6 pages, SSE, bearer auth, mobile layout)
  ledger.mjs          JSONL ledger + daily digest
  rules.mjs           anti-disturb gates (event / keyword / grace)
scripts/              channel-login.mjs · test-channel.mjs · route.mjs · gen-channel-matrix.mjs
test/                 846 tests (node --test)
```

Design rules: pure ESM (`.mjs`), zero runtime dependencies, a declarative spec engine for the bulk of channels, thin honest adapters, no build step.

## Development

```bash
npm test          # node --test, 846 cases
```

To add a channel: implement the adapter interface (`resolve(cfg)` + `send(msg)`) in `src/adapters/` and register it in `src/config.mjs`; the channel matrix above self-regenerates via `node scripts/gen-channel-matrix.mjs`.
