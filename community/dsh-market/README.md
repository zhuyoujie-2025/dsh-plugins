# dsh-market

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dshmarket)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dshmarket)
[![stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dsh-market/dsh-market?style=flat)](https://github.com/dsh-market/dsh-market)

The plugin market inside DeepSeek Harness. Open Settings → **Plugin Market** → browse, search, one-click install.

![dsh-market](assets/demo-en.png)

One-click themes — install, switch live, no restart:

![Themes tab](assets/themes-en.png)

On dsh 0.1.0-rc.7 and newer the market puts its own option where the host keeps every other plugin's — no YAML:

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dshmarket
```

Restart `dsh web`, then open **Settings → Plugin Market**.

**Requires dsh web 0.1.0-rc.6 or newer.** On an older host the market
disables itself and says so in the browser console rather than rendering
against primitives that are not there — if the Plugin Market entry never
appears, that is usually why. Worth checking when a desktop build bundles
its own dsh: it may be older than the one `npm` would give you (#139).

## What you get

- **Browse & search** the full community catalog (1250+ plugins, growing daily) — category filters, star counts, top/new sorting, bilingual descriptions that follow your UI language
- **Screenshots** — AppStore-style screenshots in the install dialog: author-curated via the registry, with automatic README extraction as fallback; images load from GitHub hosting only, and only after you open the dialog
- **Themes** — a dedicated tab for community themes and skins: install → active immediately, switch with one click (themes are mutually exclusive, your choice survives restarts), uninstall to revert
- **One-click install** — confirm the source, watch live progress; most plugins go live after a page refresh, no restart
- **Backup & restore** — export your profile's plugin list and configuration as readable JSON, import it on another machine, store it on WebDAV with daily auto-backup, or sync through a private GitHub Gist; restores **merge** (plugins installed after the backup are kept), validate before writing, and roll back on failure
- **Updates** — per-plugin update checks (npm version or pinned commit vs HEAD), one-click update, or update everything at once; the market updates itself the same way
- **Uninstall** — two-step confirm; plugins installed this session are removed live
- **Hot disable / enable** — toggles write `- id: …` + `disabled: true|false` into the profile's `cordis.patch.yml` (the official patch layer, mechanism ported from [dsh-plugin-hub](https://github.com/Noob-stupid/dsh-plugin-hub)): DSH's HMR re-composes within ~1s, no restart, and the loader re-applies the choice on every boot; hand-edited patch rows show as badges, host-infrastructure plugins are protected from toggling, and a malformed patch file is never made worse
- **Restart when needed** — changes that cannot hot-load show a one-click restart beside the pending-change banner; the action is restricted to same-origin loopback requests
- **Zero jargon** — if a component is missing (pnpm), the market detects it and offers a one-click automatic setup
- **Log export** — one click produces a sanitized plain-text log for bug reports (home paths and credential shapes are masked; nothing is ever sent anywhere). The market's version sits next to the page heading, so a screenshot of a problem already carries it
- **Settings card** — on dsh 0.1.0-rc.7 and newer the market puts its own option (whether one-click restart is allowed) on **Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration**, so a host owned by systemd, launchd or pm2 is a switch rather than a hand-edited YAML line
- **Diagnostics** — the plugin load order and conflict surface, one page: bundle stack with official/community badges, duplicate loader entries, dependency version mismatches, multi-version core packages, overrides and invalid config entries. Plain-language terms, problem blocks highlighted, everything collapsible

- **Load order** — drag community bundles into the order you want, or take the suggested one derived from the plugins' own before/after rules. Nothing is written until a trial composition passes, and the panel tells you what the new order would change (overrides, invalid or duplicate entries) before you apply it
- **AI fix** — one click copies a diagnostics-driven fix prompt (errors/warnings/order conflicts + conservative scope instructions) to the clipboard; you paste it into a new conversation and decide whether to send

## Speed

Installs prefer npm tarballs over full-repo GitHub downloads whenever a plugin publishes to npm (registry-verified against the repo to prevent name squatting). Registry installs are typically seconds; GitHub-only plugins depend on your connection to GitHub.

## Security

- Installs are restricted to sources listed in the curated [awesome-dsh-plugin](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com) registry — anything else is rejected
- Build scripts stay blocked by default (pnpm ≥10); allowing one is your explicit per-package choice
- Terminal/CLI-surface plugins are flagged before you install them into the web profile
- The install endpoint accepts same-origin POST only; the market never phones home
- Backups can contain credentials from your profile config — the UI warns before export and upload; WebDAV sync is https-only, refuses private-network targets, and never stores your password in the browser
- The restart endpoint additionally requires a direct loopback client (forwarded requests are rejected) and relaunches the exact DSH entry, arguments, environment, and working directory
- One-click restart launches a detached replacement. If DSH is managed by systemd, launchd, pm2, or another supervisor, set the plugin option `allowRestart: false` and let the supervisor own restarts instead; the pending-change notice remains visible but the button is hidden
- For terminal-attached launches, the detached replacement keeps running after the original terminal closes
- Listing ≠ endorsement: plugins are third-party code, install sources you trust

## Submit your plugin

**This repo is the market app, not the catalog.** The plugin list comes from the curated [awesome-dsh-plugin](https://github.com/awesome-dsh-plugin/awesome-dsh-plugin) registry — to get your plugin listed in the market, open a PR **there** (one entry in the list; the site and this market pick it up automatically, usually within a day). Please don't PR plugin entries against this repo.

## Roadmap & feedback

- **Bugs** go in [issues](https://github.com/dsh-market/dsh-market/issues) — attaching the market's "Export log" makes diagnosis roughly ten times faster
- **Feature ideas** go on the [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/dsh-market/projects/1). Issues are kept for things that are broken, so a proposal filed as an issue gets moved there and closed; the discussion stays where you wrote it either way
- Every roadmap item welcomes community PRs — say so on the item before starting, so two people don't build it twice
