/**
 * Layer 3 — the REAL install chain: install route → registry check → pnpm
 * resolution → post-install validation → patch layer → cordis hot mount.
 *
 * Every layer-1 spec drives this chain against a hand-written FakeDsh, so it
 * can only prove the code agrees with our MODEL of pnpm and cordis. The bugs
 * that actually shipped (#103, #122, #135, #147) were all places where that
 * model was wrong, which is why none of them could be caught there. Here
 * pnpm, cordis and the patch layer are the real ones; only the fixtures are
 * ours, and they are served from a local npm registry so nothing has to be
 * published and nothing touches the network.
 *
 * Every fixture PROVES ITS OWN LIVENESS: each registers an HTTP route from
 * inside `apply()`, which can only answer if cordis genuinely resolved the
 * package, loaded the module and ran it. The market's own activation verdict
 * is an inference and is asserted AGAINST that, never trusted as it.
 *
 * No browser: the UI journey is covered by market.e2e.ts. What is
 * unprotected — and what this spec exists for — is the host-side chain.
