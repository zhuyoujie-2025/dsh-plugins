# dsh-file-upload

**File-message plugin for DeepSeek Harness (dsh).** Claude/Codex-style uploads — drag-and-drop (files and folders), paperclip picker, paste-to-attach, multi-file support; content sniffing; fully bundled document → Markdown conversion (MarkItDown engine, 20+ formats, image OCR); Codex-style `@relative/path` references; automatic image explanations for text-only models; and a `read_document` tool for agents.

## Features

- **Upload** — composer paperclip button plus a global drag-and-drop overlay ("release to attach"), multi-file support.
- **Attachment cards** — color-coded type badges (PDF red / DOC blue / XLS green / TXT gray / ZIP purple / JSON gold) with name and size; removable.
- **Codex-style file references** — uploaded files appear in the message as `@relative/path` references (like OpenAI Codex), never as raw content dumped into the composer; the agent reads the file with `read_document` (converted to Markdown on demand).
- **Codex-style `@` mentions** — type `@` in the composer to pick any uploaded file by its relative path; the reference inserts as a mention.
- **Document → Markdown, fully bundled** — the MarkItDown engine ships inside the plugin (Microsoft MarkItDown TypeScript port, `markitdown-node`): PDF / DOCX / PPTX / XLSX / HTML / CSV / JSON / XML / RSS / Atom / ZIP / Jupyter / image OCR / audio transcription. **No Python, no downloads, no setup.**
- **Image explanation for text-only models** — upload an image and the plugin automatically generates a **description ("讲解图片")** through a vision discovery chain, so the DeepSeek API (text-only) can reason about the image: explicit `visionEndpoint` → local Ollama with a VL model (e.g. DeepSeek-VL2, zero-config) → OpenAI-compatible endpoint with a dsh-credentials key. Multimodal routes / vision bridges keep the official `read_image` path.
- **`read_document` tool for agents** — line-numbered paging (`offset`/`limit`), byte-budgeted LRU cache (invalidated on file change), size pre-checks, reads through `ctx.fs` (inherits sandbox and fs-observation policy).
- **Security** — loopback-only uploads, sanitized file names, session-isolated storage (`.dsh-uploads/<sessionId>`), sha256 content dedup, bounded concurrency, TTL sweep.

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-file-upload
# restart dsh web
```

## Usage

1. Click the paperclip in the composer toolbar, or drag files anywhere over the window;
2. Small text files land directly in the composer; documents appear as attachment cards and their path is sent with the message;
3. The agent reads documents with `read_document <path>` — converted to Markdown on demand, pageable with `offset`/`limit`.

### MarkItDown (fully bundled — no downloads, no setup)

**The MarkItDown capability ships inside the plugin. Works out of the box: no Python, no pip, no downloads, no build-script approval.**

- **Bundled engine** — the Microsoft MarkItDown TypeScript port (`markitdown-node`) is a regular dependency covering **20+ formats**: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, HTML, CSV, JSON, XML, RSS, Atom, ZIP, Jupyter notebooks, images (OCR via Tesseract, 110+ languages), and audio transcription (via LLM, needs model credentials).
- **Images** — OCR to text by default through the bundled engine.
- **Offline** — all parsing runs locally, no network calls.

> Optional upgrade: if an official MarkItDown CLI already exists on your machine (or is set via `markitdownBin`), the plugin prefers it (adds EPUB and more); without one the bundled engine is always available.

```yaml
- id: file-upload
  config:
    markitdownBin: /path/to/your/markitdown   # optional; empty = bundled engine only
```

Startup log (bundled mode):

```
[dsh-file-upload] Document → Markdown ready: bundled MarkItDown engine (20+ formats, image OCR) — fully packaged, no downloads, no Python.
```

### How images are handled (auto-explained)

The plugin **detects your session's model capability at upload time**:

| Detected route | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Multimodal model** (declares `image` input, e.g. GPT-4o / Qwen-VL / Claude / Gemini) | `imageMode: native` — the agent uses the official `read_image` tool; the image enters model context directly |
| **Vision bridge installed** ([dsh-vision-proxy](https://github.com/Flyvhidbwo/dsh-vision-proxy) and similar) | detected automatically (they declare image input on their route) — same native path |
| **Text-only model** (the DeepSeek API is text-only) | an automatic **image description** is generated via the vision discovery chain and inserted with the message — the model reasons about the image content immediately |

**Vision discovery chain** (zero-config): ① explicit `visionEndpoint`/`visionModel` → ② **local Ollama** at `http://localhost:11434` (picks a VL model such as DeepSeek-VL2 — images never leave the machine) → ③ OpenAI standard endpoint using a key from the dsh credentials seam.

> Note: DeepSeek's official API does not offer vision input (the multimodal line — DeepSeek-VL2/Janus — is open-source and self-hostable); deploy DeepSeek-VL2 via Ollama for a fully local "official DeepSeek vision" experience.

The route detection mirrors the official `read_image` gate (`ctx.llm.resolveModelInfo` + `inputModalities`).

## Development

Dual-face plugin: `dsh.bundle` (host) + `dsh.client` (web UI). No official patches — everything uses official seams (`ctx.webServer`, `ctx.tools`, `ctx.systemPrompt`, `ctx.sessions`, `slash/input-insert-text`, `slash/input-insert-reference`).

## Security

- Uploads are loopback-only and same-origin checked.
- File names are sanitized (control chars, path separators, dot segments, leading dots stripped).
- Storage is session-isolated under the session's own workspace; unknown sessions get 403.
- sha256 content dedup, bounded concurrency (429 on overload), TTL sweep.
- Text extraction parses bytes, never trusts extensions; binaries are handed to the agent by path only.
